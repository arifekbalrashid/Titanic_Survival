# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 🚢 Project Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using **Logistic Regression**.  
Based on historical data from the Titanic disaster, we use key features to estimate the likelihood of survival.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not, using important factors such as:
- **Sex**
- **Fare**
- **Passenger Class**

---

## ⚙️ Features Used
| Feature          | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Sex              | Gender of the passenger (male/female)      |
| Fare             | Fare paid for the ticket                    |
| Passenger_class  | Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class)   |

## 🧱 Model
- Algorithm: **Logistic Regression**
- Target Variable: `Survived` (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python3 titanic_survival.py
    ```

3. Evaluate the model and visualize results.

---

## 📊 Results
The model predicts survival with reasonable accuracy based on the input features.
